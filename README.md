# NB1

I am an office based neurologist in a hospital owned group practice in Bad Hersfeld, Germany.

In my medical reports I use every day a set of texts (in German).

I wrote this single-page app to have such texts at my fingertips.

It is open and free, anybody can use it or download it and change it to make it suit their needs.
