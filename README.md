# NB1

I work as an office based neurologist in a hospital owned group practice in Bad Hersfeld in Germany.

In my medical reports I use every day a set of texts (in German).
I wrote this one page app to have such texts at my fingertips.
It is open and free, anybody can use it or download it and change it to make it suit their needs. 
 
You can try the NB1: <a href="NB1.html">NB1</a>.
